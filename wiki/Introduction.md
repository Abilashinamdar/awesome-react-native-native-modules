# Introduction

Native Modules enable an app to access platform API that is not exposed to JavaScript. Their can be multiple use case for creating a Native Module, maybe you want to reuse some existing Java/Objective-C/Swift/Kotlin code without having to reimplement it in JavaScript, or write some high performance components, multi-thread code such as for image processing or any number of advanced extensions.

React Native is designed in such that it is possible for you to write real native code and have access to the full power of the platform.
